Facts about mobs.

This is very interesting actually i thought it was boring to but its interesting. Zombies are simple the zombie wants to eat your brains, they burn in daylight but they can survive if they are in water and they drop rotten flesh warning do not eat if you don’t have milk found in all biomes. Skeleton all skeleton have a bow and unlimited arrows thats crazy they should have ten arrows right crazy they too burn in the daylight and water saves them found in all biomes. Slime slime are so annoying but they don’t burn in the, daylight but slimes cant swim so drown them, slimes are found in the swamp biome and slimes can multiply so fight them under water please. Enderman man are in the end mobs ok so done wait witches oh silly me.
