There are three ocean mobs the Drowned, the Guardian and the Elder Guardian.

The Drowned

The Drowned is the annoyingest mob of all. the best way to fight drowned is to
stand one block under the water and wait for it to come (it takes seconds if
close by) then stab it with a sword this is the BEST way to fight him if he is
close by (by close by i mean roughly 15 blocks away).

The Elder Guardian

The Elder Guardian is quite scary at first when it comes up on your screen
blocking your view of the ocean and the ocean monument. An Elder Guardian atack
is 5hp on easy, 6hp on normal and 12hp on Hard. The elder guardians atack is
spiting lazers in your direction

The Guardian

The guardian is a less powerful and more colourful version of a elder Guardian.
it is found pretty far out in the ocean most likely means there is a ocean
monument nearby. Much like an elder guardian the guardian spits lazers in your
direction.
