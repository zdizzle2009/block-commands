As you have heard the nether update is out. I was excited there is a less ugly
nether! This update was action packed sadly removing zombie pigmen but adding so
many new mobs such as the piglon hoglin and strider they all have unique
abilityâ€™s and make the game way better. Mojang have added many many new blocks
as well as biomes there are now not only nether fortresses but bastions as well.
Bastions are filled with black stone gold and piglons.
